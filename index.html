	<p id="text">So basicly, as you can see this is how its supposed to look like. Text are typing letter by letter. Some kinda of animated wish card. User can exter any text and my website will generate a webpage and give user a link. He can sent that link to someone as wish card. Ofc, user will be able to use fonts he wants, to change size, to add little stickers on which i will add eff of drawing so it looks cool like this one.</p>
